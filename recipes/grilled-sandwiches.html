    <p class="opis">
        This is a delicious grilled chicken panini recipe that is fast and easy to make. Use boneless, skinless chicken breasts for lean protein that is 
        well-seasoned and scented with rosemary and garlic. The chicken breasts can be grilled ahead of time and then used to make slices for sandwiches 
        for the next couple of days. As well, the grilled chicken can also be added to salads for another quick and healthy dinner or lunch.

        As for the sandwich itself, you may have a panini maker or George Foreman grill that you like to use. But you can also use the old-school method 
        and press it right there on your gas or charcoal grill. While you could simply grill it without pressing it, for a real panini feel you need a weight. 
        There are cast iron tools such as a grill press or bacon press that work well for this, sitting on top of the sandwich. But an equally effective tool 
        is a clean brick wrapped in a couple of layers of aluminum foil. You will need oven mitts to manipulate the hot weight or brick.
