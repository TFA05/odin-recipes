A website I made following The Odin Project using only HTML.

It was my first time using git and GitHub which made it a valuable learning experience on making a website using a VCS. 
The entire HTML side of the project wasn't too challenging as I already had web programming classes in school which covered 
most of the things used, but the GitHub side was something new and could use some more of getting used to.
